<h2>
Professional Career
</h2>

<p>
Ever since childhood, I have been deeply fascinated by mathematics, science, and engineering. This early curiosity gradually evolved into a focused academic interest, particularly in applied mathematics and control theory. My first undergraduate course in control systems was a pivotal moment, as it revealed the depth, rigor, and elegance of the field, igniting a passion that has shaped my academic and professional trajectory.
</p>

<p> 
While my initial focus lay in addressing theoretical gaps and developing control methodologies with formal guarantees, my research interests have since evolved toward more applied directions. I am now increasingly engaged with machine learning and robotics, where I continue to prioritize practical relevance and safety-critical performance. My work remains grounded in the core principles of control theory, but is now directed toward solving real-world problems that benefit from both theoretical soundness and experimental validation.

<h2>
Current Research
</h2>

<p>
I am currently focused on the field of robot learning, where I aim to develop robust and scalable motion planning solutions that integrate principles from control theory. My research emphasizes methods that ensure stability, convergence, and safety guarantees, particularly in scenarios where robotic systems operate under uncertainty or external disturbances.

In addition, I work on problems in active learning and data-driven analysis to better understand and enhance the exploration behavior of motion planning algorithms. By leveraging insights from both theoretical foundations and empirical observations, my goal is to design learning-based control strategies that are both reliable and adaptive across different robotic applications.

<h2>
Education and Experience
</h2>

<p>
Prior to joining the Technical University of Munich, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Systems Theory and Automatic Control, University of Stuttgart (August 2023 – December 2024), where I worked under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Frank Allgöwer. My research there primarily focused on safety verification and controller synthesis for switched and real-time control systems.

I earned my Ph.D. in September 2023 at the Software and Computational Systems Lab, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Majid Zamani. My doctoral thesis focused on the formal analysis of control systems via inductive techniques, with an emphasis on barrier function-based approaches for both verification and control synthesis. The work addressed challenges related to scalability, conservatism, and the design of correct-by-construction controllers for complex logic specifications.

In early 2023, I was a visiting researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, where I collaborated with Prof. George Pappas on neural network-based methods for the safety verification of unknown or distributed systems.

I hold a Master of Technology in Systems and Control from the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, and a Bachelor of Technology from SRM Institute of Science and Technology, India. From 2018 to 2019, I was awarded the DAAD IIT-MSP scholarship, during which I completed my master’s thesis at the Hybrid Control Systems Lab, Technical University of Munich.
