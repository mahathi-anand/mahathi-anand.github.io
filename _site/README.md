Mahathi Anand is currently a postdoctoral researcher at the chair of Robotics and Systems Intelligence and Munich Institute of Robotics and Machine Intelligence, Technical University of Munich. 
She was a postdoctoral researcher at Institue for Systems Theory and Automatic Control, University of Stuttgart, working with Prof. Frank Allg√∂wer after obtaining her PhD in Computer Science at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Germany under the supervision of Prof. Majid Zamani. 
Her thesis was entitled "Formal Analysis of Control Systems via Inductive Approaches: Tackling Scalability, Conservatism, and Complex Specifications" and dealt with developing for safety verification and controller synthesis of a wide class of nonlinear control systems using barrier functions and automata theory. 
Since then, her interests have delved into learning-based approaches, which unfortunately 
Mahathi's expertise lies in the intersection of control theory, formal methods, robotics and machine learning. She is interested in developing methodology for using safe and certified learning-based approaches for the planning and control of robotic systems. She has several published papers across several control conferences and journals including Transactions on Automatic Control, Nonlinear Analysis-Hybrid Systems, Conference on Decision and Control, etc.
