    <h1>Hi, I am Mahathi Anand</h1>

    <p> I am a postdoctoral researcher and project manager at Munich Institute of Robotics and Machine Intelligence (MIRMI), Technical University of Munich. My technical expertise lies at the intersection of control theory, formal methods, machine learning and robotics. I am passionate about leveraging my math and programming skills to solve meaningful real world problems. My research focuses on developing safe, reliable and efficient control algorithms for autonomous systems, and love to bridge the gap between theoretical results and practical deployment.
